## Introduction

As an Apple user, I wanted cameras that work seamlessly with HomeKit. No extra apps if possible. No accounts that feel sketchy. Just *it works*.

After testing the top HomeKit cameras for 6 months, here's my honest breakdown.

---

## Quick Comparison

| Camera | Price | HomeKit | Resolution | Storage | Smart Features |
|--------|-------|---------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Eve Indoor Cam** | $99 | ✅ Native | 1080p | iCloud (paid) | Good |
| **Aqara G4 Doorbell** | $129 | ✅ Native | 1080p | SD + Cloud | Excellent |
| **Eufy S350** | $129 | ⚠️ Bridge | 4K | Local | Very Good |

## Eve Indoor Cam 🏆 Best for Simplicity

### The Good

- **True HomeKit integration** — no bridge needed
- HomeKit Secure Video compatible
- Clean, minimal design
- Privacy shutter (physical!)
- Great iPhone notifications

### The Not-So-Good

- Only 1080p (no 4K)
- Must pay for iCloud+ for recording
- No person/pet/vehicle detection without paid iCloud
- No outdoor use

### My Experience

Setting up the Eve was *refreshing*. Add to Home app, done. It just works with my Apple TV as a hub.

The privacy shutter is a nice touch — when I'm home, the camera physically blocks the lens. Peace of mind.

**The catch:** You *need* an iCloud+ plan ($2.99+/month) to record. That adds up.

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)**

## Aqara G4 Doorbell 📦 Best Doorbell Option

### The Good

- **HomeKit Secure Video** native
- Face recognition (local processing!)
-SD card slot + cloud storage options
- Great detection zones
- Works without subscription

### The Not-So-Good

- Wired only (no battery option)
- Requires existing doorbell wiring
- Chime is separate purchase ($20)
- Ugly design, honestly

### My Experience

The Aqara G4 is the **best value** for HomeKit users. Here's why:

1. **No subscription required** — SD card works
2. **Local face recognition** — privacy-friendly
3. **Actually cheap** — $129 one-time

The design is... not great. It looks like a chunky tablet on your door. But function over form, right?

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ (4.5/5)**

## Eufy S350: The Powerful Alternative

### The Good

- **4K resolution** — crisp detail
- Auto-tracking (follows movement)
- Great value for features
- Local storage (no fees)

### The Not-So-Good

- Requires Eufy bridge for HomeKit
- Bridge needs ethernet (extra device)
- HomeKit support is secondary
- Some features need Eufy app

### My Experience

The S350 is powerful, but it's not a *pure* HomeKit experience. You need:

1. The Eufy Security bridge
2. The Eufy app for setup
3. Adding both to HomeKit

Once set up, it works. But it's more complex than Eve or Aqara.

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐½ (3.5/5)**
