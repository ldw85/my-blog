## 🎨 Vibrant Colors Steal the Spotlight

According to well-known leaker "Instant Digital" on Weibo, the event invitation features a 3D Apple logo made of transparent discs in yellow, green, and blue — hinting at colorful new product options.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman revealed in his latest newsletter that Apple has tested a range of playful color options including:

- 🟡 Light Yellow
- 🟢 Light Green
- 🔵 Blue
- 🌸 Pink
- ⚪ Classic Silver
- ⚫ Dark Gray

While not all colors will ship, this palette would make the budget MacBook the most colorful laptop Apple has offered since the iBook G3 in the late 1990s, which featured iconic colors like Tangerine, Blueberry, Indigo, Graphite, and Key Lime.

## 📱 Specs Predictions

Based on analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's previous predictions, here are the expected specifications:

| Spec | Prediction |
|------|------------|
| **Display** | 12.9-inch |
| **Chip** | A18 Pro (iPhone 16 Pro) |
| **Body** | Aluminum chassis |
| **Starting Price** | Under $1,000 |
| **Brand** | MacBook (no Air/Pro) |

Notably, this device will use an iPhone chip rather than the M-series — a first for a consumer Mac. While powerful, the A18 Pro may have limitations compared to M-series chips for professional workloads, positioning this as an entry-level device for education and everyday use.
