## Introduction

When deploying OpenClaw, most people's first instinct is to rent a VPS server. But after running my own AI assistant setup for over a year, I'm here to tell you: **Mac mini is the better choice for most users** — and the new M4 chip makes it even better.

This article compares VPS and Mac mini across multiple dimensions to help you make the optimal decision.

## VPS vs Mac mini Comparison

| **Public Access** | ✅ Direct | ❌ Requires tunnel |
| **Performance** | Limited | Excellent |
| **Stability** | Provider dependent | Excellent |
| **Noise** | None | Silent |
| **Data Security** | Cloud-based | Fully local |
| **24/7 Operation** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Resale Value** | None | ~50% after 3 years |

## The New Mac mini M4: A Game Changer

The latest Mac mini with M4 chip is an impressive piece of hardware:

## Why I Recommend Mac mini?

### 1. Cost Analysis

Let's do the math:

| Duration | VPS ($15/mo) | Mac mini M4 |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 Year | $180 | $599 |
| 2 Years | $360 | $599 |
| 3 Years | $540 | $599 |
| 4 Years | $720 | $599 |

**Verdict**: Mac mini pays for itself after 2-3 years.

### 2. Performance

Mac mini M4 performance is in a different league:

- **Same-price VPS**: 2-4 cores, 4-8GB RAM
- **Mac mini M4**: 10-core CPU, 16GB+ RAM, 38 TOPS Neural Engine

For running OpenClaw + supporting services, this matters.

### 3. Stability and Reliability

**VPS Pain Points:**
- Provider downtime
- Network fluctuations
- Disk failures
- Migration hassles

### 4. Privacy and Security Concerns

This is a critical consideration for personal AI assistants:

**VPS Privacy Risks:**
- Your OpenClaw will have access to sensitive account credentials (GitHub, X/Twitter, email, banking APIs)
- These highly private keys are stored on third-party remote servers
- Even with best practices, there's always some attack surface on cloud infrastructure
- Data traverses the internet constantly, increasing exposure risk

**Mac mini Privacy Advantages:**
- All credentials stay on your local device
- Use **1Password** or similar to manage secrets locally
- No data leaves your home network unless you explicitly allow it
- Complete physical and logical control over your AI assistant
- Integrate with 1Password for secure credential management

### 5. Workflow Integration

**VPS Limitations:**
- As a remote server, you can't just "open the desktop" to work
- Need to upload files to VPS for OpenClaw to access them
- Disconnected from your daily workflow
- Can't easily share screen, drag-drop files, or collaborate in real-time

**Mac mini Advantages:**
- OpenClaw operates on your local machine, always ready
- Seamlessly work alongside your AI assistant on the same desktop
- Drag-and-drop files, share screens instantly
- Natural human-AI collaboration — just turn on the monitor and work together

### 6. My Real Setup

| Component | My Setup |
|-----------|----------|
| **Host** | Mac mini M4 (24GB) |
| **AI Assistant** | OpenClaw |
| **Public Access** | Cloudflare Tunnel |
| **Uptime** | 24/7 |
| **Electricity** | ~$5/month |
