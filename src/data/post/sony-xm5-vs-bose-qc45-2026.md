## Sound Quality: The Most Important Factor

Let's be honest — if you're spending $300+ on headphones, you want them to sound amazing.

### Sony WH-1000XM5

The XM5 delivers **crisp, detailed audio** with the kind of bass that hits without overwhelming. The 30mm drivers are specifically designed for this headset, and it shows.

**What I love:**
- Instrument separation is excellent
- Vocals sound natural, not overly processed
- LDAC support for hi-res audio
- DSEE Extreme upscales compressed audio in real-time

**The catch:** The default sound profile is bass-heavy out of the box. You'll want to tweak it in the Sony Headphones Connect app.

### Bose QC45

The QC45 takes a more **neutral approach**. Think of it as the "reference sound" of consumer headphones — what the artist actually intended you to hear.

**What I love:**
- Natural midrange (vocals sound incredible)
- No frequency range overpowers another
- Comfortable for long listening sessions
- No app EQ needed

**The catch:** At this price, I'd expect more. The soundstage feels narrower than the XM5, and there's no hi-res audio support.

**🎧 My pick for sound quality: Sony WH-1000XM5**

## Noise Cancellation: The Key Differentiator

This is where things get interesting. Both are excellent, but they excel in different scenarios.

### Sony WH-1000XM5 🏆

Sony's ANC is simply **the best in class**. The QN1 processor + dual processors create a cocoon of silence.

**Real-world testing:**
- ✈️ Airplane: Blocks almost all engine noise
- 🚇 Subway: Drastic reduction in train rumble
- 🏠 Office: Keyboard clicks? What keyboard clicks?
- 🗣️ Voice: Reduces nearby conversations significantly

The auto-anc optimization adapts to your environment — it actually works, not just a gimmick.

### Bose QC45

Bose pioneered ANC, and the QC45 is still excellent. But it's not quite at Sony's level anymore.

**Real-world testing:**
- ✈️ Airplane: Very good, but you hear more than XM5
- 🚇 Subway: Good, but not great
- 🏠 Office: Excellent for consistent noise
- 🗣️ Voice: Struggles with sudden loud voices

**🎧 My pick for ANC: Sony WH-1000XM5**

## Comfort: The Sleeper Factor

Here's where Bose strikes back.

### Bose QC45 🏆

The QC45 is **the most comfortable premium headphone I've ever worn**. The padding is plush, the clamp is gentle, and I can wear them for 4+ hours without any discomfort.

- Weight: 240g
- Very soft ear cushions
- Minimal clamp pressure
- Great for glasses wearers

### Sony WH-1000XM5

Don't get me wrong — they're comfortable. But the design trade-offs are noticeable:

- Weight: 250g (heavier)
- Smaller ear cups (my ears touch the inside)
- More clamp pressure
- Better for shorter sessions

**🎧 My pick for comfort: Bose QC45**

## Battery Life & Charging

| Headphones | Battery | Quick Charge |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Sony XM5 | 30 hours | 3 min = 3 hours |
| Bose QC45 | 24 hours | 15 min = 3 hours |

**Real-world note:** With ANC constantly on, expect about 25 hours from XM5 and 20 hours from QC45.

**🎧 My pick: Sony WH-1000XM5**

---

## Call Quality

Both work well for calls, but there's a clear winner.

### Sony WH-1000XM5 🏆

- 4 beamforming microphones
- AI-based noise reduction
- Wind noise reduction
- **My verdict: Excellent for calls**

### Bose QC45

- 4 microphones
- Good in quiet environments
- Struggles with wind
- **My verdict: Fine for occasional calls**
